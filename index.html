<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<p>This is a data scienctist position. I would need to develope artificial intelligence 
    I.T products via working as a team with other software engineers and data scientists. 
    I would be making programs that use machine learning by using algorithms to obtain data to learn from it, 
    then the program can predict future trends or predicts what the user of that app or program requires for 
    work or entertainment from past patterns.(https://www.simplilearn.com/data-science-vs-data-analytics-vs-machine-learning-article )
    This position appeals too me because I want to be apart this exciting future,
    who knows where it will take me maybe I could be programming cars to drive 
    themselves or in 30 years time I might be programming robots to do chores around peoples homes. 
    Its also very well paid not that money is everything but it shows that a job like this has great value in the job market. 
    As I mentioned previously its less demanding physically, 
    maybe in the future all physical work could be obsolete and ive made the best decision I could of made for my own survival in 
    the job market.</p>
