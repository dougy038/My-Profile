          <p>

I have choose to study at RMIT to change my career path and I found this university to have a great reputation in the I.T field.
I have always been involved in computers my whole life my first computer was an Atari st, my next computer was a Pentium 100, back then it was 
the best technology, after that i found myself rebuilding computers for gaming. I enjoy online gaming when i have time, i go on discord and chat 
with friends while playing, my favorite games include Conan exiles and Rust. As for my working life I worked for a bathroom renovation company where 
I eventually became a tradesman after that, I entered the mining construction industry which i have done on and off for 5 solid years.
What lead me to study again was the fact That I am not happy in my current career, I believe I have more to offer than being a trade assistant in the mines or renovating bathrooms. 
Another reason I have choosen I.T is I have become older and I need to have a field with is less physical and more mental, I believe that I.T is a massively growing industry 
which will have a great demand in the future, I want to fill that demand. After I Graduate I want to continue study in the A.I field, 
Humankind has only scratched the surface of this field and I believe the future is automation, robots, Robotic suits and limbs to give back disabled peoples ability to walk again or use their arms again. 
There will be self driving cars and perhaps even aircraft. All these possible advancements will need an I.T professional to come part of it, which will be me.  
I was born in Australia but my father was born in Denmark, my family and I still maintain our culture at Christmas time. 
Back in 2005 i started a bachelor of science degree at Adelaide university where i did around 1.5 years towards the degree. My interests include fishing and gaming.

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  
     <p>
    My project idea is a system to automate aquaponics, aquponics is a system 
    where you farm fresh water fish and grow plants, the water with uneaten fish food and feces is 
    used feed plants.The plants it inturn clean the water and its pumped back into he fish tank. 
    I propose using a Rasberry Pi system too automate this process, through turing the hydoponic lights on during night time and 
    activating pump to pump he freshwater back into the tank, tempreture control on the fish tank.also the 
    gathering of A.I data to optemise yeilds.
</p>
   <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
          There are close to 8 billion people in the world and food is always going to be a major commodity 
          especially in china which relies heavily on importing food. The resources of the world are 
          finite and this system is a lot more efficient than standard aquaculture. In standard aquaculture they need to flush the 
          waste water away too stop the nitrogen build up in the water.Thus this system can provide fish and plants for the 
          demand of hungry humans too eat the AI application through using raspberry Pi will gather important data overtime too
          eventually create more yields with efficient use of finite resources like power and water.   
            </p>
   <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
     
  <img src ="projct.JPG" alt="fishfarm" >
                    </p>
  
  <p>As shown in the diagram you can have 4 system in which can be automated, 
    firstly the fish food feeder, secondly the pump which pumps the waste water from the fish tank to the flood tank 
   triggered via the ammonia sensor,thirdly you will have the hydroponic lights for the 
   plants at night time and finally a thermostat for the fish tank.For example,use the WiFi raspberry pi 
   too pump the waste water when intructed by the ammonia sensor, 
  feeder you can have set at every 12 hours, the hydroponic lights can be automated from 6pm to 6am 
  finally he thermostat depending on the fish breed will have a range say the temp needs to be from 15 to 20 
  degrees,the rasberry PI can turn on the element within the range of that temperature. 

Now imagine you can do is say you have 100 of these aquaponic farms and you were wanting to optimize them  with artificial intelligence.
You have 3 variables 
fish food
wattage of hydro lights 
water temperature 
these three things you can increase or decrease to find the perfect balance between power consumption and yield.
For example
you can change these numbers say fish farm 1 feed is set every 8 hours with 300watt globes,
    in farm 2 feed every 10 hours with 500 watt globes 
   farm 3 feed every 11 hours but have 1000 watt  
    globes. 
 I propose that these 3 variables are changed over farms 1-20 but mimicked on farms 21-40,41-60,61-80, 
    and finally 81-100, now on the other farms you can grow different things such as tomatoes,cucumbers lettuces 
    plus different species of fish etc
 Every time you harvest you now record the time taken plus the yield from the harvest and the power consumption once you have enough 
    data you can use a A.I program witch can eventually run these systems to get maximum yield and efficiency.
Picture an employee on the farm once this system is in place, the computer asks you what crop are you using?
What species is the fish, how big are the fish are they fingerlings? ,1kg or 2kg and whats the wattage of the hydroponic lights? 
What fish feed are you using?
Once you type this information in the computer knows when and how much too feed the fish, when to turn on the hydro
    lights when to turn them off, what temperature to idea for that certain spices of fish.
The Rasberry PI will be connected via Wifi with a main computer monitoring the farms and will 
    give the A.I information and tell them what to do.
   This will make them completely automated reducing costs of labor and human error. 
  </p>
  <h3>Tools and technologies </h3>
  <p>This Project will need Rasberry PI's On WIFI and a power source to power them, they will control 
    through a main computer which will give them commands to follow.

You will need a greenhouses, grow beds,fishtanks, pipes,flood tanks, hydroponic lights, 
    an ammonia sensor a pumps, fish food feeders all these will also require a power source. 

Secondly you will need to have software Linux Raspbian to run them, as for the A.I aspect  
    Python coding is best as its coding is a lot easier and efficient.  
</p>
  <h3>Skills required </h3>
  <p>For the project to succeed you will need to wire and install the modules and powersouce, 
    build a green house and a flood tank stand, have a big fish tank, perhaps a rain water tank could be used.

You will need to know how to write all the software to automate the fishfeeder,thermostat,pump and hydo lights.
Also the knowledge to write the A.I program once you have enough data colected.
This project is very feasible to get the skills required. 
 firstly learn programming and A.I through obtaining a degree in I.T, as for hareware all the parts can be obtained throught EBAY and Amazon.
</p>
<h3>Outcome </h3>
  <p>If the project is successful an completely automated farm that produces 
    fish and vegtables will come into existance, will it solve world hunger probably not however its a start. 
    This development if expanded and made into a large producer with automating planting of seeds,
    will cut out the expensive labour aspect of farming you could charge cheaper then everybody 
    else and make a big impact on the market.
