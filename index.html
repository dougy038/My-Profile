  <h2>Career test</h2>
  <img src ="career.JPG" alt="career">
  <p>
    these test results show me I am determined person with a logical thinking mind, 
    my independent test shows I have chosen the right path in studying I.T., well these results suggest im a lone wolf 
    that likes working alone however im happy to working a team, m not the type of person that wants a leader role for the
    sake of being a leader,but I will takeover if I am the best man  for the job to move from point a to b. In forming a team 
    I would want everybody that wants to do the best job possible If there member on te team that just wants a 
    50% pass mark it would annoy me because he/she will let everybody else down.
